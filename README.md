# RestClient-Application
REST based Web Application and Client made using Maven and Java

The Web Application is using GlassFish that comes with Netbeans. It connects to a MySQL databse that is all local.
So this project will not work on your machine unless you change the code to work with your own MySQL and Netbeans.

I am using Maven as a client to contact with the Web Application. Making me able to change and handle the MySQL DataBase.
